# hello-world
This is where I introduce myself to the community, tell about the projects I'm currently working on, share my interests, ideas and propose discussions. 

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a university student of Science and Technology, and also from Energy Engineering and Mathematics at Universidade Federal of ABC (one of the highest-ranked universities of Brazil).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning data science and how to program with Python, R, Julia, and SQL. My intentions are to use as a tool that helps me develop a better understanding of power & energy supply system.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects of group studies in optimization methods, operacional research, mathematical modelling and more. My main focus is to study power electrical systems using programming tools.
